## About the Repository
This repository is a collection of my SQL learning materials and problem-solving approaches. It includes:
- **SQL notes**: Comprehensive notes covering the basics of SQL, advanced queries, optimization tips, and more.
- **Solutions**: My solutions to problems on HackerRank and LeetCode, broken down by topic.
- **Practice Exercises**: Additional exercises that I use to sharpen my skills.


## Notes on SQL
The **Notes** section contains well-structured, easy-to-understand explanations of SQL topics. Here’s a list of some of the key topics covered in the notes:
- Basic SQL Commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)
- Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- Subqueries and Nested Queries
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Indexing and Performance Optimization
- Stored Procedures and Functions
- Database Design and Normalization

You can view the detailed notes [here](./notes/SQL_Notes.md). Coming soonn....

## Problem Solutions
In this section, you will find my solutions to various SQL problems from platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode. Each solution is documented with the problem statement, my approach, and the SQL query.

### HackerRank Solutions
All my HackerRank SQL problem solutions can be found in the [HackerRank folder](./hackerrank/).
- **Easy Level**: Problems focused on basic SQL queries and commands.
- **Medium Level**: Problems involving more complex joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- **Hard Level**: Challenging problems that require optimization and advanced SQL techniques.


### LeetCode Solutions
All my LeetCode SQL problem solutions are available in the [LeetCode folder](./leetcode/).
- Problems are categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and by topic (joins, subqueries, window functions, etc.).

Each solution file contains:
- **Problem Statement**: The question as it appears on the platform.
- **My Approach**: A brief explanation of how I tackled the problem.
- **SQL Query**: The final SQL query that solves the problem.

## How to Use the Solutions
To test or use any of the solutions locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-notes-and-solutions.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the relevant problem folder (HackerRank or LeetCode).
3. Open the SQL file of the problem you're interested in and copy the query.
4. Run the query in your preferred SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

## Topics Covered
The solutions and notes in this repository cover a wide range of SQL topics. Some of the main topics include:
- Basic Querying
- Joins and Unions
- Grouping and Aggregation
- Subqueries
- Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
- Window Functions
- Indexing and Performance Tuning
- Transactions and Concurrency

This repository will help you strengthen your SQL skills across these areas.
